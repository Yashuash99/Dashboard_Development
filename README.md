TASK DESCRIPTION: This project is a Personalized Health Insights Dashboard built using Dash by Plotly, designed to help users visually monitor and analyze key health metrics over time. It leverages interactive data visualizations to present vital health data—such as heart rate, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other attributes—through dynamic charts and graphs. The dashboard is built with Python and uses Dash for the front-end, alongside pandas for data manipulation and plotly.express for creating insightful visuals. Users can filter data by date, view trend lines, and interpret their overall health status in an intuitive, user-friendly interface. The goal of this dashboard is to transform raw health data into actionable insights, supporting both general users and healthcare practitioners in making informed decisions. Developed in VS Code, this project demonstrates the integration of clean UI design, real-time interactivity, and Python-based data science workflows into a single responsive dashboard experience.
